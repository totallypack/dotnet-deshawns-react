# DeShawn's Dog Walking
OVERVIEW:
In this project I build a full stack application with a React client and .NET API. This project uses a different method for handling CORS. (In vite.config.js)

In DeShawn's Dog Walking, a city can have many walkers in it, and a walker can walk in many cities. Therefore, the relationship between walker and city is many-to-many.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
Full-stack development
React ecosystem
.NET Web API development
RESTful API design
Database relationship modeling
User experience design
Problem-solving and debugging
